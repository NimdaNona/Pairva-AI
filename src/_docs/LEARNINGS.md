## Planning & Architecture Insights

### Application Complexity Analysis

During the planning phase, we've identified several areas of complexity that will require special attention:

1. **Dynamic Questionnaire Logic**:
   - Implementing complex branching logic while maintaining performance
   - Storing and retrieving question flow state efficiently
   - Balancing thoroughness with user engagement

2. **AI Integration Challenges**:
   - Optimizing OpenAI API usage for cost efficiency
   - Designing effective prompt templates for compatibility analysis
   - Implementing robust fallback mechanisms for API unavailability
   - Balancing batch processing with perceived real-time experience

3. **User Matching Complexity**:
   - Cold start problem with limited initial user base
   - Balancing match quality with match quantity
   - Implementing efficient pre-filtering before expensive AI analysis
   - Designing for perceived fairness in match distribution

4. **Hybrid Data Storage**:
   - Maintaining consistency between different database systems
   - Optimizing query patterns across different storage technologies
   - Implementing efficient data access patterns for microservices

### Research Findings

Research conducted during planning has revealed several important insights:

1. **Vector Embedding Approach**:
   - OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model provides good performance for semantic similarity
   - Cosine similarity with a threshold of 0.65 seems to provide good balance for pre-filtering
   - MongoDB vector search capabilities can efficiently handle our expected user scale
   - Document embeddings work better than averaged token embeddings for this use case

2. **AI-Powered Matching Research**:
   - Structured prompt design with clear instructions yields more consistent results
   - Including vector similarity scores as context improves compatibility analysis
   - JSON output format with fixed schema improves parsing reliability
   - Clear separation between free/premium insights simplifies feature gating

3. **Questionnaire UX Research**:
   - Users start experiencing fatigue after approximately 20-25 questions
   - Progress indicators significantly improve completion rates
   - Grouping related questions into visually distinct sections improves engagement
   - Adaptive difficulty based on previous answers maintains interest

## Technical Best Practices

### AWS Infrastructure

1. **Multi-AZ Deployment**:
   - Deploy across multiple availability zones for high availability
   - Use AWS Application Load Balancer for service distribution
   - Implement automatic failover for database services
   - Design for graceful degradation when services are impaired

2. **Infrastructure as Code Guidelines**:
   - Use constructs for reusable components
   - Organize CDK stacks by service boundary
   - Implement consistent tagging strategy for resources
   - Use environment-based configuration patterns

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Implement auto-scaling based on load patterns
   - Use spot instances for batch processing jobs
   - Implement lifecycle policies for S3 and database backups
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for cost anomalies

### API Design Patterns

1. **RESTful API Guidelines**:
   - Use consistent URL patterns: `/v1/{service}/{resource}`
   - Implement proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Include pagination for list endpoints
   - Document with OpenAPI/Swagger

2. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Keep access tokens short-lived (1 hour)
   - Use refresh tokens for session persistence
   - Implement proper CORS configuration
   - Use scoped permissions based on user role and subscription tier

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Return standardized error response format
   - Include request ID for traceability
   - Provide actionable error messages for client
   - Log detailed error information server-side

## Database & Data Management

### Schema Design Principles

1. **PostgreSQL Best Practices**:
   - Use UUID as primary keys for distributed system compatibility
   - Implement proper indexing strategy for query patterns
   - Use foreign key constraints for data integrity
   - Implement table partitioning for large tables (e.g., messages)

2. **MongoDB Schema Design**:
   - Balance between normalized and embedded documents
   - Design for query patterns, not just data relationships
   - Use appropriate index types for query patterns
   - Implement TTL indexes for expiring data

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache match results to reduce database load
   - Implement proper cache invalidation triggers
   - Use Redis Sorted Sets for ranked match lists
   - Implement sliding window rate limiting

### Data Security & Privacy

1. **Encryption Approach**:
   - Encrypt data at rest using AWS KMS
   - Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data
   - Use TLS 1.2+ for all data in transit
   - Implement proper key rotation policies

2. **User Data Privacy**:
   - Store only necessary personal information
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Provide user data export functionality
   - Design for compliance with privacy regulations

## DevOps & CI/CD

### Deployment Strategy

1. **CI/CD Pipeline Design**:
   - Implement trunk-based development workflow
   - Automate testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, e2e)
   - Use feature flags for controlled rollout
   - Implement blue/green deployments for zero-downtime updates

2. **Monitoring & Observability**:
   - Implement structured logging with correlation IDs
   - Set up centralized log aggregation
   - Create service dashboards for key metrics
   - Implement distributed tracing with X-Ray

3. **Alerting & Incident Response**:
   - Define alert thresholds based on SLOs
   - Implement tiered alerting based on severity
   - Create runbooks for common incidents
   - Set up on-call rotation for critical issues

## Mobile & Frontend Development
