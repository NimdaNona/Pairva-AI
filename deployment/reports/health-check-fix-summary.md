# Health Check Issue Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

After analyzing deployment logs and the TaskDefinitions-Output.txt, the primary issue causing deployment instability was identified:

- The frontend service was failing health checks because the designated `/health` endpoint didn't exist in the Next.js application
- The error message indicated: "frontend service event: (service pairva-frontend-service) (task 55bb1afd27ba449f94a64115fb6a686b) failed container health checks"
- The service was unable to stabilize within the 900-second timeout period

## Changes Implemented

1. **Added frontend health check endpoints:**
   - Created a page route at `/health` (frontend/src/pages/health.jsx)
   - Created an API route at `/api/health` (frontend/src/pages/api/health.js)
   - Both endpoints return a 200 OK status code with appropriate headers

2. **Health check configuration improvements:**
   - The Update-TaskDefinitions.ps1 script was already enhancing health check settings:
     - Increased timeout: 10s → 15s
     - Increased retry attempts: 5 → 7
     - Extended start period: 120s → 180s

3. **Network and infrastructure fixes:**
   - Added VPC creation capabilities to the Update-TaskDefinitions.ps1 script
   - Fixed CloudWatch log group command ambiguity issue by properly formatting parameter names
   - Implemented IAM policy attachment error handling with fallback to ECR ReadOnly policy

## Testing and Verification

The health check endpoints were implemented to meet the exact paths expected by the container health check configuration:

```json
"healthCheck": {
  "command": ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1"],
  "interval": 30,
  "timeout": 15,
  "retries": 7,
  "startPeriod": 180
}
```

The implementation follows best practices for health check endpoints:
- Lightweight responses to minimize resource usage
- Proper HTTP headers and status codes
- Simple responses optimized for health checking

## Recommended Deployment Process

1. Build the updated Docker images with the new health check endpoints:
   ```
   .\infrastructure\scripts\Build-DockerImages.ps1 -Version "1.0.2" -Verbose
   ```

2. Process the task definitions with all the fixes applied:
   ```
   .\infrastructure\scripts\Update-TaskDefinitions.ps1 -Version "1.0.2" -CreateNetworkResources -Verbose
   ```

3. Deploy the application with the processed task definitions:
   ```
   .\infrastructure\scripts\Deploy-Production.ps1 -Version "1.0.2" -UseProcessedTaskDefs -Verbose
   ```

## Future Considerations

1. **Health Check Monitoring:**
   - Consider adding more comprehensive health checks that verify backend connectivity
   - Implement application-specific health metrics in the health check response

2. **Deployment Stability:**
   - Monitor deployment success rates after these changes
   - Consider extending timeout periods further if needed

3. **Documentation:**
   - Document the new health check endpoints in the project's API documentation
   - Add health check verification to pre-deployment checklists
