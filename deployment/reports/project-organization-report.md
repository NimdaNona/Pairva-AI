# Project Organization and Port Configuration Report

## Overview

This report documents the improvements made to the Perfect-Match project organization and configuration consistency.

## 1. Port Configuration Standardization

We addressed port configuration inconsistencies across the project:

- **Backend API Service**: Standardized to use port `3000` internally and externally
  - Modified backend Dockerfile to expose port 3000
  - Ensured backend task definition uses container port 3000
  - Set PORT environment variable to 3000 in all configuration files
  - Updated health check endpoint to use the correct port

- **Frontend Service**: Standardized to use port `3000` internally, mapped to `3001` externally
  - Docker Compose mapping is set to 3001:3000 for the frontend service
  - Ensured frontend task definition uses container port 3000

- **Service Communication**: 
  - Updated auth.controller.ts to use port 3000 for frontend URL reference
  - Updated notificationsApi.ts to use port 3000 for API URL reference

A detailed documentation of these changes is available at `config/docs/port-configuration.md`.

## 2. Project File Organization

The following organizational improvements were implemented:

### Deployment Files

All deployment-related files have been organized into a clear structure:

- `deployment/configs/` - Configuration files and deployment checklists
- `deployment/reports/` - Deployment reports and post-mortem analyses
- `deployment/logs/` - Build and deployment logs
- `deployment/monitoring/` - Post-deployment monitoring reports
- `deployment/test-reports/` - Test reports and test user data

### Infrastructure Files

- `infrastructure/task-definitions/` - ECS task definition files properly organized
  - Includes backend and frontend task definitions with their variants

## 3. File Naming Conventions

We established a clearer naming convention for deployment-related files:

- Logs: `deployment-{date}-{time}.log`, `docker-build-{date}-{time}.log`
- Reports: `deployment-report-{date}.html`, `{purpose}_{description}.md`
- Configurations: `{purpose}-{type}.{ext}`

## Benefits

These improvements provide several key benefits:

1. **Reduced Deployment Errors**: Consistent port configuration prevents connectivity issues
2. **Improved Developer Experience**: Clearer file organization makes it easier to find resources
3. **Better Maintenance**: Logical file structure assists in troubleshooting and maintenance
4. **Scalability**: Organized structure allows for better scaling as the project grows

## Next Steps

Consider implementing these additional improvements:

1. Create an automated script to verify port configuration consistency
2. Implement a consistent logging strategy with rotation policies
3. Enhance documentation with a visual diagram of the deployment architecture
