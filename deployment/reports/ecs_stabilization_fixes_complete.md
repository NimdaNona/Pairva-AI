# ECS Stabilization Issues - Complete Fix Report

## Summary of Implemented Changes

This report documents all the fixes implemented to resolve the ECS service stabilization issues during deployment of the Pairva application.

## 1. Task Definition Health Check Improvements

### Backend & Frontend Task Definitions
- **Changes made**:
  - Increased health check timeout from 5 to 10 seconds
  - Increased retries from 3 to 5
  - Increased startPeriod from 60 to 120 seconds
- **Benefits**: Provides containers more time to properly start up before being flagged as unhealthy

## 2. Dockerfile Enhancements

### Backend Dockerfile
- **Changes made**:
  - Added UTF-8 locale settings: `ENV LANG=en_US.UTF-8` and `ENV LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`
  - Verified health check endpoint URL is correct

### Frontend Dockerfile
- **Changes made**:
  - Fixed health check path from `/api/health` to just `/health`
  - Verified UTF-8 locale settings are properly set

## 3. Deployment Script Enhancement

### Error Investigation Capabilities
- **Added**:
  - New `Get-FailedTaskInfo` function that retrieves:
    - Stopped task details
    - Container failure reasons
    - Exit codes
    - CloudWatch logs for failed containers
- **Benefits**: Provides detailed diagnostic information when tasks fail to start

### Task Definition Validation
- **Added**:
  - Pre-flight checks to verify task definitions are Fargate-compatible
  - Verification of essential properties: 
    - `networkMode=awsvpc`
    - `requiresCompatibilities=["FARGATE"]`
- **Benefits**: Catches configuration issues before deployment starts

### Real-time Service Stability Monitoring
- **Changes made**:
  - Replaced infinite `aws ecs wait` with custom monitoring logic
  - Added 15-minute timeout for all service stabilization operations
  - Real-time reporting on running vs. desired task counts
  - Collection of service events for troubleshooting
- **Benefits**: 
  - Prevents deployment script from hanging indefinitely
  - Provides precise information about stabilization status

### Post-Deployment Validation
- **Added**:
  - Automatic verification of service state after deployment
  - Task failure investigation if services don't reach desired counts
- **Benefits**: Automatically captures diagnostic information without manual intervention

## Testing Instructions

To test all improvements:

1. **Build Images**:
   ```
   .\infrastructure\scripts\Build-DockerImages.ps1 -Version "1.0.1"
   ```

2. **Deploy with Stabilization Improvements**:
   ```
   .\infrastructure\scripts\Deploy-Production.ps1 -Version "1.0.1" -Verbose
   ```

3. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Watch for real-time status updates with timestamps
   - Observe the new stability checks in action
   - Review detailed diagnostic information if any issues occur

## Conclusion

The implemented changes create a much more robust deployment process with:
- Better tolerance for container startup delays
- Enhanced character encoding support
- Detailed diagnostics for failures
- Prevention of script hangs through proper timeouts
- Proactive verification of configuration requirements

These improvements significantly reduce the risk of failed deployments and provide better visibility into any issues that might occur.
