# Pairva Application Deployment Report

## Deployment Summary

**Date:** April 29, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0.1  
**Environment:** Production (AWS ECS/Fargate)  
**Status:** ❌ Failed  

## Deployment Process

1. ✅ **Docker Images Build (Success)**
   - Backend image successfully built and pushed to ECR: `039612856036.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pairva-backend:1.0.1`
   - Frontend image successfully built and pushed to ECR: `039612856036.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pairva-frontend:1.0.1`
   - Build completed in approximately 1 minute 39 seconds

2. ❌ **Deployment Script Execution (Failed)**
   - The environment verification phase passed successfully
   - Task definition registration failed with error: "Fargate requires task definition to have execution role ARN to support log driver awslogs"
   - Service update attempted with empty task definition reference
   - Both backend and frontend services continued cycling through task failures

## Critical Issues

1. **Task Definition Registration Failure**
   - The execution role ARN in task definitions contains variable placeholders that are not properly resolved:
   ```json
   "executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole"
   ```
   - The deployment script did not properly substitute the placeholder with actual AWS account ID
   - Task definition registration failed, causing the subsequent service update to fail

2. **Service Health Check Failures**
   - Backend service: 0 running tasks, 1 pending task, 7,560+ failed tasks
   - Frontend service: Multiple deployments in progress, continuous health check failures
   - Services are repeatedly creating and terminating tasks that fail health checks

3. **CloudWatch Logs Configuration**
   - The log group for tasks does not exist: `/aws/ecs/pairva-cluster`
   - Unable to retrieve logs from failed tasks for proper debugging

## Root Causes

1. **Variable Substitution**
   - The task definition templates contain placeholder variables that are not properly processed before registration
   - The scripts do not have a proper preprocessing step to replace variables in task definitions

2. **IAM Role Configuration**
   - The ECS execution role may not exist or lacks proper permissions
   - Task definitions reference roles that may not be properly configured

3. **Container Health Check Issues**
   - Task health checks are failing, indicating the containers are not starting properly
   - May be related to environment variable configuration or application startup issues

## Recommended Actions

1. **Fix Task Definition Templates**
   - Create the proper IAM roles required for ECS execution
   - Update the Deploy-Production.ps1 script to properly substitute variables in task definitions
   - Example fix:
   ```powershell
   $taskDefContent = Get-Content -Path $taskDefPath -Raw
   $taskDefContent = $taskDefContent.Replace('${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}', $AccountId)
   $taskDefContent = $taskDefContent.Replace('${AWS_REGION}', $Region)
   $taskDefContent = $taskDefContent.Replace('${VERSION}', $Version)
   $taskDefContent | Set-Content -Path $processedTaskDefPath
   ```

2. **Create Required CloudWatch Log Groups**
   - Ensure the log groups specified in task definitions exist before deployment
   - Create log groups with appropriate retention periods

3. **Debug Container Health Checks**
   - Temporarily relax health check requirements to allow tasks to start
   - Deploy a simpler container to verify network and infrastructure configuration

4. **Service Configuration**
   - Review and validate network configuration (security groups, subnets)
   - Verify that the ECS cluster and services are properly configured

## Next Steps

1. Fix the task definition variable substitution in the deployment scripts
2. Create the missing IAM roles or update the task definitions to use existing roles
3. Ensure all required CloudWatch log groups exist
4. Redeploy with fixed task definitions and monitor task status
5. If tasks still fail health checks, examine container logs for application-specific issues

## Conclusion

The deployment of version 1.0.1 failed due to task definition registration errors caused by unresolved variables and missing IAM roles. This led to a cascading failure where services were attempting to start tasks that could not be properly executed. The high number of failed tasks (7,500+) indicates this problem has been ongoing for some time.

A proper fix requires updating the deployment scripts to correctly process task definition templates and ensuring all prerequisite resources (IAM roles, log groups) exist before deployment.
