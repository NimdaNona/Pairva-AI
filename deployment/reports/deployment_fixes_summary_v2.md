## Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend MongoDB Schema Issue
- **Problem**: `CannotDetermineTypeError: Cannot determine a type for the \"Conversation.metadata\" field`
- **Root Cause**: NestJS Mongoose schema type ambiguity with MongooseSchema.Types.Mixed
- **Solution Implemented**: Changed type from `MongooseSchema.Types.Mixed` to `Object` in conversation.schema.ts
- **File Modified**: `backend/src/modules/messaging/schemas/conversation.schema.ts`

### 2. Frontend Character Encoding Issue
- **Problem**: Unicode triangle symbol (â–²) causing 'charmap' codec error
- **Root Cause**: Missing UTF-8 locale configuration in the container
- **Solution Implemented**: Added locale environment variables in two places:
  - Frontend Dockerfile:
    ```dockerfile
    ENV LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    ENV LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
    ```
  - Frontend task definition:
    ```json
    { \"name\": \"LANG\", \"value\": \"en_US.UTF-8\" },
    { \"name\": \"LC_ALL\", \"value\": \"en_US.UTF-8\" }
    ```

### 3. Deployment Script Task Definition Issue
- **Problem**: Script was trying to use version strings (like '20250429-121630') as task definition revisions
- **Root Cause**: Deployment script used the version parameter directly with task definitions
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - Completely refactored the deployment process to register new task definitions with updated images
  - Added proper task definition extraction, modification, and registration
  - Enhanced to preserve required attributes like 'networkMode' for Fargate compatibility

## Implementation Details

### Deployment Script Enhancements:
1. **New Task Definition Registration Process**:
   - Get current task definition from ECS
   - Update container image with new version tag
   - Save task definition to temp file with all required properties
   - Register new task definition with AWS ECS
   - Use the ARN of newly registered task definition for service update

2. **Fargate Compatibility Fix**:
   - Preserved 'networkMode' attribute in task definition JSON
   - Added proper error handling and logging
   - Enhanced task definition handling for both frontend and backend

3. **Rollback Improvements**:
   - Updated rollback function to properly handle task definition ARNs
   - Added better error checking and validation

## Testing Results

The script was successfully tested with a test deployment using version '1.0.1'. The script now:
1. Correctly extracts current task definitions
2. Updates container image references
3. Registers new task definitions with Fargate-compatible networkMode
4. Updates services with the new task definitions

## Conclusion

The deployment issues have been resolved by:
1. Fixing the MongoDB schema type issue in the backend code
2. Adding proper UTF-8 locale support to the frontend container
3. Completely refactoring the deployment script to handle task definitions correctly

These changes ensure that:
- The backend can correctly process MongoDB schemas with complex types
- The frontend can properly display Unicode characters
- The deployment process correctly handles task definition versions and registration

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring deployments to ensure stability
2. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for locale and encoding issues
3. Review other schema definitions for similar MongoDB type issues
4. Consider enhancing the deployment script with additional error handling and reporting"
