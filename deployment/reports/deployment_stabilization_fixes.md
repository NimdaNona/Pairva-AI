# ECS Service Stabilization Fixes Report

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Task Definition Health Check Improvements

#### Backend Task Definition
- **File Modified**: `infrastructure/task-definitions/backend-task-def.json`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Increased health check timeout from 5 to 10 seconds
  - Increased health check retries from 3 to 5
  - Increased health check startPeriod from 60 to 120 seconds
- **Benefit**: Provides more time for the backend service to initialize properly before being marked unhealthy

#### Frontend Task Definition
- **File Modified**: `infrastructure/task-definitions/frontend-task-def.json`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Increased health check timeout from 5 to 10 seconds
  - Increased health check retries from 3 to 5
  - Increased health check startPeriod from 60 to 120 seconds
- **Verification**: Confirmed that locale environment variables (LANG, LC_ALL) were already properly set

### 2. Deployment Script Timeout Enhancements

#### Timeout Logic for Service Stability
- **File Modified**: `infrastructure/scripts/Deploy-Production.ps1`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Implemented timeout mechanism for backend service stabilization wait
  - Implemented timeout mechanism for frontend service stabilization wait
  - Added timeout mechanism for rollback operations
  
#### Enhanced Monitoring and Logging
- Added detailed status reporting during deployment
- Implemented service event collection when services fail to stabilize
- Added logging of running vs. desired tasks for better visibility
- Set reasonable 15-minute timeout for all stabilization operations

## Testing Strategy

To test these changes:

1. Deploy a new version using: 
   ```
   .\infrastructure\scripts\Deploy-Production.ps1 -Version "1.0.1" -Verbose
   ```

2. Monitor the deployment process with improved status reporting

3. If issues occur, the script will automatically collect diagnostic information

## Summary

These changes significantly improve the resilience and reliability of the deployment process by:

1. Giving containers more time to initialize and pass health checks
2. Preventing deployment script hangs with proper timeout handling
3. Providing better visibility into service status during deployment
4. Collecting diagnostic information when deployments don't stabilize
