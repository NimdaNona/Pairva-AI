# Infrastructure Reorganization

## Directory Structure Changes

We have reorganized the deployment-related files and infrastructure resources into a more structured format:

```
Perfect-Match/
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── task-definitions/      # Container task definition templates
│   │   ├── backend-task-def.json
│   │   ├── frontend-task-def.json
│   │   ├── backend-task-def-prepared.json  # Generated files with variables substituted
│   │   └── frontend-task-def-prepared.json
│   └── scripts/
│       ├── Update-TaskDefinitions.ps1      # New script for task definition preprocessing
│       ├── Deploy-Production.ps1           # Original deployment script
│       └── Deploy-Production-Fixed.ps1     # Enhanced deployment script
├── deployment/
│   ├── logs/                  # Centralized location for deployment logs
│   ├── reports/               # Deployment reports and summaries
│   └── test-results/          # Test results and verification reports
└── [other project folders...]
```

## File Migration

The following files have been moved to their new locations:

1. Task definition files moved to `infrastructure/task-definitions/`:
   - `backend-task-def.json`
   - `frontend-task-def.json`
   - `backend-task-def-prepared.json` (generated)
   - `frontend-task-def-prepared.json` (generated)

2. Deployment reports moved to `deployment/reports/`:
   - `deployment-report-*.html`
   - `deployment-readiness-report.md`
   - `post-deployment-monitoring.md`

3. Test reports moved to `deployment/test-results/`:
   - `test-report-*.html`

## New Infrastructure Scripts

We've created the following new deployment scripts:

1. **Update-TaskDefinitions.ps1**
   - Purpose: Process task definition templates by replacing all placeholder variables
   - Functions:
     - Variable substitution for AWS account ID, region, and version
     - Verification of required IAM roles
     - Creation of CloudWatch log groups

2. **Deploy-Production-Fixed.ps1**
   - Purpose: Enhanced deployment script with better error handling and verification
   - Improvements:
     - Pre-deployment environment verification
     - Proper task definition processing
     - Better error handling and diagnostics
     - Enhanced health checks and monitoring

## Benefits of Reorganization

1. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of deployment artifacts, logs, and reports
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify deployment resources
3. **Enhanced Deployment Process**: More reliable with proper variable substitution
4. **Better Visibility**: Centralized reporting and logging for troubleshooting
5. **Reduced Errors**: Clear separation of template and generated files

## Usage Guidelines

For future deployments, follow this process:

1. First process task definitions:
   ```powershell
   .\infrastructure\scripts\Update-TaskDefinitions.ps1 -Version "1.0.2"
   ```

2. Then deploy using processed task definitions:
   ```powershell
   .\infrastructure\scripts\Deploy-Production-Fixed.ps1 -UseProcessedTaskDefs -Version "1.0.2"
   ```
