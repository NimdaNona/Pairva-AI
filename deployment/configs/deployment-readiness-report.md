# Pairva Deployment Readiness Report

## Task Definition Fixes

We identified issues with the task definitions that were causing deployment problems:

1. **IAM Role Issues**: 
   - Both frontend and backend task definitions were referencing custom IAM roles (`pairvaBackendTaskRole` and `pairvaFrontendTaskRole`) that were either non-existent or lacked proper permissions.
   - Error: `ECS was unable to assume the role that was provided for this task`

2. **Solution Implemented**:
   - Created new task definitions (backend:4 and frontend:3) that:
     - Removed the custom taskRoleArn references
     - Kept only the standard `ecsTaskExecutionRole` which has the necessary permissions
     - Maintained all other configuration parameters (environment variables, port mappings, etc.)

## Current Deployment Status

- **Backend Service**:
  - Using task definition: `pairva-backend:4` (registered successfully)
  - Deployment status: In progress with failed tasks
  - Current attempts show tasks failing to launch
  
- **Frontend Service**:
  - Original task (pairva-frontend:1) is currently running
  - New deployment (pairva-frontend:3) is in progress but with failed tasks
  - The original frontend task continues to run

## Next Steps

To complete the deployment:

1. We need to forcefully restart the services using the proper task definitions
2. Verify task launches successfully with new task definitions
3. Implement proper IAM roles with correct permissions if custom task roles are required in the future
4. Update the CI/CD pipeline to include deployment validation checks

## Recommendations

1. Create proper IAM task roles with appropriate permissions
2. Implement health checks in both frontend and backend applications
3. Consider implementing blue/green deployments for zero-downtime updates
4. Add alerting for failed task launches
