1.	Questionnaire Architecture: Complex Decision Tree with Modular “Blocks”
a.	Modular Blocks or Sections
i.	Group related questions (e.g., “Core Values,” “Communication Style,” “Lifestyle & Habits,” “Interests & Hobbies”) into distinct sections.
ii.	Each section can contain multiple branching paths, but the user only sees the branches relevant to them.
b.	Adaptive Branching
i.	Decide branching based on pivotal answers. For example, if a user rates “high importance” on Religion, advanced religious compatibility questions appear; if not, that block is skipped.
c.	Question Pool Ballpark Estimate
i.	Total Question Pool: ~50 to 100 questions.
ii.	Typical User Exposure: ~60–70% of these questions (30–50 actual questions answered), depending on branching logic.
2.	Designing Questions for GPT Analysis
a.	To ensure GPT can produce highly confident compatibility scores, create a well-defined structure that captures both the user’s explicit choices and any open-ended responses:
i.	Structured + Open-Ended Hybrid
1.	Structured Fields: Store multiple-choice answers, sliders, or Boolean toggles directly in your database (e.g., “Rate the importance of honesty: 1–10”).
2.	Open-Ended Fields: Give users opportunities to elaborate on key topics (e.g., “Describe your views on conflict resolution in a relationship.”). GPT can analyze these free-text responses and map them to relevant traits.
ii.	Semantic Tagging or Categorization
1.	If you allow open-ended responses, consider converting them to semantic embeddings or categorizing them under key traits or topics. This way, GPT has consistent data points to use for compatibility analysis.
iii.	Prompt Engineering for Analysis
1.	When calling the OpenAI API, pass GPT a structured prompt that includes the user’s answers in a clear format (JSON, bullet points, or labeled data).
2.	Provide context on how to weigh certain attributes (i.e., “Core Values = 30%, Communication = 25%,” etc.).
iv.	Weighting in the Prompt
1.	Prompt Example: Please analyze the following user data. Each answer has an associated 'importance_score' based on the user’s preferences. Return a summary of key compatibility dimensions and a recommended weighting for each, focusing on factors: {Core Values, Interests & Hobbies, Communication, Personality Traits, ...}
3.	Combating Question Fatigue
a.	Progress Indicators & Sectioned Flow
i.	Progress Bars: Show how many sections or questions remain in each section.
b.	Smart Skips
i.	If a user’s answers in earlier sections strongly indicate certain preferences, skip subsequent questions that would be redundant. (e.g., if a user specifies they do not want children and rates it extremely important, skip further questions about parenting philosophies.)
c.	Intuitive, Concise Question Wording
i.	Keep each question direct, with minimal jargon.
ii.	Combine or group highly related questions into single multi-part items (“Rate how strongly you agree with each statement below” with bullet statements).
4.	Implementation Flow for GPT-Driven Matching
a.	User Completes Questionnaire
i.	The user navigates the branched questionnaire. Branches appear or disappear based on relevant triggers (importance scores, yes/no answers, etc.).
b.	Data Storage
i.	Structured Data: Store numeric responses, booleans, multiple-choice answers, etc., in your database (relational or NoSQL).
ii.	Open-Ended Text: Store free-text responses. Optionally convert them to embeddings or store them in a separate text field for GPT usage.
c.	Prompt Construction
i.	Once the user finishes, construct a structured payload that includes:
1.	Weighted numeric data (e.g., “WantsKids = true (importance=high)”)
2.	Summarized or raw open-ended answers
3.	The weighting schema (30% Core Values, 25% Communication, etc.)
d.	GPT Matching Logic
i.	GPT can:
1.	Summarize the user’s “love profile” into a set of bullet points or a standard schema
2.	Generate or update their compatibility vector
3.	Perform deeper contextual analysis
4.	Compare among all users in the database
e.	Post-Processing
i.	Save GPT’s summarized “love profile” and “key compatibility factors” to the database.
ii.	Use these GPT-generated summaries to present personalized insights.
iii.	Combine numeric scoring with GPT’s deeper contextual analysis for a final compatibility score.
5.	Putting It All Together
a.	Complex Decision Tree with up to 50–100 questions subdivided into modules.
b.	Adaptive Flow that prioritizes user’s top concerns and gracefully bypasses irrelevant areas.
c.	Structured + Open-Ended to let GPT glean nuanced personality insights while preserving a standardized numeric foundation.
d.	Mitigate Fatigue using dynamic skipping, and user-driven completion points.
e.	Robust GPT Integration that uses carefully crafted prompts with both numeric and textual data to generate high-quality compatibility determinations.
By combining thoughtful branching logic, smart UX techniques to reduce fatigue, and clear data structures for GPT analysis, you’ll enable both a user-friendly experience and high-confidence AI-driven matching.
