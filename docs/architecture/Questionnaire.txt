Step 1: Define Questionnaire Objectives
The main objectives of your questionnaire should include:

Capturing a clear understanding of the user's personality, lifestyle, and relationship expectations.

Adjusting dynamically to reveal deeper insights based on user input.

Maintaining user engagement and minimizing questionnaire fatigue.

Step 2: Proposed Structure & Flow
The questionnaire could follow a progressive, dynamic structure like this:

1. Initial Broad Questions (Basic Level)

Age, location, gender, relationship goals (casual, serious, marriage, friendship), and basic demographics.

Basic interests and hobbies.

Purpose: Quickly segment users and set the stage for deeper exploration.

Example:

"What are you looking for right now?" (Friendship, Casual Dating, Serious Relationship, Marriage)

2. Intermediate Questions (Adaptive & Personalized) Based on initial answers, more targeted questions appear dynamically:

Personality traits (introversion vs. extroversion, emotional intelligence, openness, etc.)

Lifestyle choices (career-oriented, adventurous, homebody, social habits)

Preferences in a partner (traits, values, priorities)

Purpose: Gain a deeper understanding tailored specifically to previous responses.

Adaptive Example:

If the user selects "Serious Relationship," subsequent questions may explore views on long-term compatibility, conflict resolution, financial management, or future family plans.

If "Casual Dating" is selected, focus on personality compatibility, immediate interests, and interaction styles.

3. Advanced Questions (Situational and Behavioral) These appear dynamically based on earlier choices and delve into relationship behaviors, values, and compatibility dimensions:

Scenario-based questions (e.g., reactions to conflict, jealousy, career conflicts, or living arrangements)

Behavioral assessment (communication style, attachment style, emotional expression, handling stress)

Deal-breakers or essential must-haves

Purpose: Understand nuanced behaviors that significantly impact compatibility.

Situational Example:

"How would you prefer your partner to handle disagreements?"

A. Direct and immediate discussion

B. Give each other space before addressing issues

C. Seek mediation or counseling immediately

Step 3: Questionnaire Adaptability
To keep engagement high and avoid fatigue:

Conditional Branching:
Questions should dynamically adjust their complexity and direction based on previous answers, ensuring the experience remains tailored and relevant.

Progressive Disclosure:
Show progress bars and indicators of how close the user is to completing their profile to maintain motivation.

Step 4: Question Types and UX/UI Considerations
Integrate various interactive question types:

Multiple-choice (for quick and easy selections)

Sliding scales (to gauge strength of preference)

Interactive visuals (icons for lifestyle preferences, hobbies)

Situational scenario cards (brief scenarios with intuitive responses)

User Experience:
Ensure intuitive navigation, appealing visual design, and gamified elements (badges, progress visualization) to enhance completion rates.

Step 5: Scoring and Backend Integration
Each question and response should have weighted values tied to compatibility dimensions.

AI (e.g., OpenAI gpt-4 model API) uses these weighted dimensions to generate comprehensive Love Profiles.

Compatibility scores should be transparent enough for users to trust the system but nuanced enough to be meaningful.

Step 6: User Validation
Allow users to confirm or adjust their responses periodically.

Example Dynamic Flow Scenario
User selects "Serious Relationship"

Questionnaire adapts by prioritizing long-term compatibility questions such as "Do you want children?" or "How important is financial stability in your partner?"

User identifies as introverted

Follow-up questions appear, asking about preferred social scenarios, comfort levels in group settings, or ideal frequency of social events.

User identifies communication as a critical factor

The questionnaire expands into detailed questions on conflict resolution styles, openness in communication, emotional expression, and comfort with vulnerability.
