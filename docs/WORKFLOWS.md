## Core User Journeys

### 1. User Registration and Profile Creation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant Auth as Authentication Service
    participant Profile as Profile Management
    participant Quest as Questionnaire Engine
    participant AI as AI Service
    
    User->>Auth: Register (email/password or social)
    Auth-->>User: Confirm registration
    
    User->>Auth: Verify email (if applicable)
    Auth-->>User: Email verified
    
    User->>Profile: Create basic profile
    Profile-->>User: Basic profile created
    
    User->>Profile: Upload profile photos
    Profile-->>User: Photos uploaded
    
    User->>Quest: Start questionnaire
    
    loop Questionnaire Flow
        Quest->>User: Present adaptive questions
        User->>Quest: Submit answers
        Quest->>Quest: Apply branching logic
    end
    
    Quest->>AI: Generate profile analysis
    AI-->>Quest: Return profile insights
    
    Quest->>Profile: Update profile completion status
    Profile-->>User: Profile completion confirmed
```

**Critical Steps and Decision Points:**

1. **Registration Method Selection**:
   - Email/password registration requires email verification
   - Social login bypasses email verification but requires provider token

2. **Profile Photo Requirements**:
   - At least one profile photo required
   - Face verification check to ensure quality

3. **Questionnaire Completion**:
   - User must complete minimum required questions (approx. 60% of presented questions)
   - Branching logic adapts based on previous answers
   - Importance weighting affects match calculations

4. **Profile Analysis**:
   - AI service processes all responses
   - Generates profile summary and key traits
   - Creates embedding vectors for future matching

**Error Handling and Edge Cases:**

- If email verification fails, user can request new verification email
- If questionnaire is abandoned mid-way, progress is saved and can be resumed
- If AI service is unavailable, profile completion is queued for later processing

### 2. Daily Match Generation Process

        UseVectorOnly --> GenerateBasicInsights[Generate Basic Insights]
        GenerateBasicInsights --> StoreMatches
    end
```

**Critical Steps and Decision Points:**

1. **Scheduling**:
   - Process runs daily at 3:00 AM UTC
   - Considers all users active in the last 30 days

2. **Pre-filtering Criteria**:
   - Location proximity (based on user preferences)
   - Age preferences (mutual compatibility)
   - Gender preferences (mutual compatibility)
   - Relationship goal alignment

3. **Vector Similarity**:
   - Uses embedding vectors generated during profile creation
   - Calculates cosine similarity between vectors
   - Sets minimum threshold of 0.65 for further consideration

4. **AI Processing Considerations**:
   - Batch size of 50 potential matches per API call
   - Timeout of 15 seconds per batch
   - Retry mechanism (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
   - Switch to DeepSeek API if OpenAI failure rate exceeds 10%

5. **Compatibility Score Generation**:
   - Raw score from AI (0-100)
   - Weighted by importance factors from questionnaire
   - Adjustment based on profile completeness (0.8-1.0 factor)

6. **Match Distribution Controls**:
   - Free users: Maximum 10 new matches per day
   - Premium users: Maximum 50 new matches per day
   - Minimum compatibility threshold: 70% for standard delivery

**Error Handling and Edge Cases:**

- If AI services are completely unavailable, fall back to vector similarity scores only
- If user pool is small in a geographic area, expand search radius progressively
- For new users with few matches, artificially boost visibility in the first week

### 3. User Match Discovery and Interaction

```mermaid

    end
    
    User->>Chat: Send message
    Chat->>Notif: Notify recipient
    Notif-->>Match: Deliver new message notification
```

**Critical Steps and Decision Points:**

1. **Match Presentation Strategy**:
   - Sorted by compatibility score (highest first)
   - Daily limit enforced (10 for free, 50 for premium)
   - Premium users: Full match list available
   - Free users: Limited to most recent matches

2. **Compatibility Insight Access**:
   - Free users: Basic summary and top 3 compatibility factors
   - Premium users: Comprehensive analysis, conversation starters, potential challenges

3. **Like Mechanism**:
   - One-sided likes stored but not immediately visible to recipient
   - Premium users can see who liked them
   - Mutual likes automatically enable conversation

4. **Conversation Initiation**:
   - Requires mutual like to enable messaging
   - Free users: Basic text and image messaging
   - Premium users: Access to AI-generated conversation starters

**Error Handling and Edge Cases:**

- If match details cannot be retrieved, show basic information with option to refresh
- If user unmatches or blocks, immediately remove from match lists and disable conversation
- If message delivery fails, retry with exponential backoff and notify sender of delivery status
