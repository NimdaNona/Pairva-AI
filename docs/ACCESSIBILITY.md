# Accessibility Guidelines for Perfect Match

This document outlines the accessibility standards, practices, and implementation details for the Perfect Match application. Our goal is to build an inclusive application that everyone can use, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

## Standards Compliance

Perfect Match is designed to meet or exceed **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance requirements. This includes:

- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable
- **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies

## Implementation Details

### Keyboard Accessibility

- **Focus Management**: All interactive elements receive visible focus indicators
- **Focus Trapping**: Modal dialogs and other overlays trap focus to prevent keyboard users from unintentionally navigating to hidden content
- **Skip Links**: Skip navigation links are provided to bypass repetitive content and navigate directly to main content areas
- **Logical Focus Order**: Tab order follows a logical sequence that preserves meaning and operability

### Screen Reader Support

- **ARIA Attributes**: Proper ARIA roles, states, and properties are used to enhance screen reader interaction
- **Live Regions**: Dynamic content changes are announced to screen reader users using `aria-live` regions
- **Form Labeling**: All form controls have properly associated labels
- **Semantic HTML**: Semantic HTML elements are used to provide implicit meaning and structure
- **Meaningful Text Alternatives**: Images and icons include appropriate alt text or accessible labels

### Visual Design

- **Color Contrast**: Text content maintains a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against its background
- **Text Sizing**: Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- **Multiple Cues**: Information is never conveyed by color alone and includes additional indicators
- **Focus Visibility**: Focus indicators have sufficient contrast against adjacent colors (3:1 minimum)

### Content and Navigation

- **Proper Heading Structure**: Content is organized using properly nested heading levels (h1-h6)
- **Descriptive Link Text**: Links provide context about their destination or purpose when read in isolation
- **Consistent Navigation**: Navigation patterns and component behavior are consistent throughout the application
- **Error Identification**: Form errors are clearly identified and described in text

## Accessibility Components and Utilities

The following components and utilities have been implemented to support accessibility:

### Components

- **Button**: An accessible button component that supports keyboard interactions, ARIA attributes, and visible focus styles
- **MatchCard**: Enhanced with ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader announcements
- **ProfileSetupLayout**: Includes proper heading structure, keyboard navigation, and screen reader announcements
- **QuestionRenderer**: Form components with associated labels, error handling, and screen reader support

### Utilities

- **accessibility.ts**: Provides functions for:
  - Screen reader announcements
  - Focus management
  - Focus trapping in modals
  - Skip navigation links
  - Programmatic focus management for errors
  - Color contrast checking

## Testing Procedures

To ensure accessibility compliance, the following testing methods are employed:

### Automated Testing

- **Axe or similar tools**: Integrated into the development and CI/CD process to catch common accessibility issues
- **Jest with Testing Library**: Used for component testing with accessibility assertions
- **Contrast checkers**: Verify that text colors meet minimum contrast requirements

### Manual Testing

- **Keyboard-only navigation**: Test all functionality without using a mouse
- **Screen reader testing**: Verify functionality with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- **Zoom testing**: Check the application at different zoom levels (up to 200%)
- **Reduced motion**: Test with reduced motion preferences enabled

## Accessibility Statement

Perfect Match is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience for everyone and applying the relevant accessibility standards.

### Conformance Status

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. Perfect Match is fully conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA.

### Feedback

We welcome your feedback on the accessibility of Perfect Match. If you encounter accessibility barriers, please contact us at:

### Assessment Approach

Perfect Match has been assessed both internally and with the help of external accessibility consultants. Regular accessibility audits are performed to ensure continued compliance as new features are added.

## Future Improvements

While we strive for complete accessibility, we recognize there is always room for improvement. Future accessibility enhancements planned include:

1. Implementing support for voice commands
2. Providing sign language videos for key information
3. Advanced color contrast tools for users with color vision deficiencies
4. Extended language support with built-in translation capabilities
5. Enhanced cognitive accessibility features
